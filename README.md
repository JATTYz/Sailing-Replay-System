# SAIL REPLAY WEB APPLICATION - GROUP AC4 
## Group AC4 - Technology Application Project 2023, Swinburne University of Technology

Welcome to the Sail Journey 3D Graphic Render project! This application is designed to replay and visualize sail journeys in 3D graphics. Below, you'll find an overview of the technologies and tools used in this project.

## Tech Stack

- **Web-based**: This application is compatible for web-based usage, ensuring accessibility for users across different platforms.

- **React (Front-end)**: We use React for building the front-end of the application, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Three.js (3D Graphic Rendering)**: Three.js is utilized for rendering 3D graphics, allowing us to create immersive and visually appealing sail journey representations.

- **Plotly (Chart Plotting)**: Plotly is used to create interactive charts and visualizations, enhancing the overall user experience and providing valuable data insights.

- **Vite (JS Build Tool)**: Vite is employed as a JavaScript build tool, making development and deployment more efficient and reliable.

- **GitHub**: We host our project on GitHub, making it easy to collaborate, track changes, and manage the project's source code and documentation.
